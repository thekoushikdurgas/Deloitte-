============================================================
üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================
1. Review IF-THEN-END IF block matching issues
2. Check LOOP-END LOOP statement pairing
3. Verify semicolon placement for SQL statements
4. Consider manual review of complex nested structures
5. Test formatted code before deployment
6. Address any failed formatting attempts

============================================================
üìä ORACLE FORMATTING FEATURES APPLIED
