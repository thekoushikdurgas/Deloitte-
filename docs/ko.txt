## Detailed Comparison Analysis

Let me analyze the differences between your current JSON output and the expected JSON files:

### **Issue 1: Incomplete Logic in trigger1.json**

**Current Output (trigger1.json)**:
- Contains only partial conversion of Oracle trigger
- SQL is truncated and missing significant business logic
- Variables are not properly declared
- Missing crucial INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE logic

**Expected Output (ex-trigger1.json)**:
- Complete PostgreSQL conversion with full business logic
- Proper variable declarations with correct PostgreSQL data types
- Complete INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE sections with all necessary validations
- Proper error handling and exception management

### **Issue 2: Incomplete Logic in trigger2.json**

**Current Output (trigger2.json)**:
- Missing proper variable declarations
- SQL logic is incomplete
- Error handling is not properly converted

**Expected Output (ex-trigger2.json)**:
- Complete PostgreSQL DO block with proper variable declarations
- Full business logic for molecule mapping
- Proper error handling and validation

### **Issue 3: Incomplete Logic in trigger3.json**

**Current Output (trigger3.json)**:
- Similar issues with incomplete conversion
- Missing business logic
- Improper variable handling

**Expected Output (ex-trigger3.json)**:
- Complete company address handling logic
- Proper validation and error handling
- Complete business workflow

## **Root Cause Analysis**

Based on my analysis of your codebase and the comparison of the JSON files, here are the main issues causing the differences:

### **1. Incomplete Section Extraction**
The current `extract_sections()` method in `convert.py` is not properly parsing all the Oracle trigger logic. It's missing:
- Complex nested IF conditions
- Shared code between INSERT/UPDATE operations
- Complete business logic blocks

### **2. Variable Declaration Issues**
The `extract_variables_and_constants()` method is not capturing all variable declarations properly:
- Missing variable type conversions
- Incomplete %TYPE reference handling
- Not preserving variable initialization values

### **3. Data Type Conversion Problems**
The PostgreSQL data type mappings are incomplete:
- Missing proper %TYPE to PostgreSQL type mappings
- Incorrect handling of Oracle-specific types
- Schema-qualified types not properly converted

### **4. Business Logic Truncation**
The conversion process is truncating important business logic:
- Exception handling blocks are incomplete
- Complex nested conditions are not fully parsed
- Procedure calls are not properly converted

## **Comprehensive Summary of Differences**

### **Major Issues Found:**

| **Issue Category** | **Current Output** | **Expected Output** | **Impact** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Variable Declarations** | Missing or incomplete | Complete with proper PostgreSQL types | High |
| **Business Logic** | Truncated/incomplete | Complete with all validations | Critical |
| **Error Handling** | Basic exception conversion | Comprehensive error management | High |
| **Data Type Mapping** | Incomplete conversions | Proper PostgreSQL types | Medium |
| **Schema References** | Missing or incorrect | Proper schema qualification | Medium |
| **Procedure Calls** | Not properly converted | CALL statements with correct syntax | High |

### **Specific Examples of Issues:**

1. **Variable Declaration Missing:**
   - Current: Basic variable list
   - Expected: Complete variable declarations with proper types like `v_evolved_nmp_cnt INTEGER`, `v_trademark_no gmd.v_themes.trademark_no%type`

2. **Business Logic Incomplete:**
   - Current: Partial IF conditions
   - Expected: Complete business workflows with nested conditions, loops, and proper validation

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Current: Basic RAISE EXCEPTION statements
   - Expected: Comprehensive exception handling with specific error messages and proper flow control

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Improve Section Parsing:** Enhance the `_parse_oracle_trigger()` method to handle complex nested structures
2. **Fix Variable Extraction:** Update `extract_variables_and_constants()` to capture all variable declarations with proper types
3. **Complete Business Logic:** Ensure all Oracle trigger logic is properly converted without truncation
4. **Enhance Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive exception handling conversion
5. **Improve Data Type Mappings:** Add complete Oracle to PostgreSQL type mappings

## **Final Summary**

Your current Oracle to PostgreSQL converter is producing incomplete JSON outputs compared to the expected results. The main issues are:

1. **Incomplete Parsing**: The Oracle trigger sections are not being fully extracted and converted
2. **Missing Variables**: Variable declarations are incomplete or missing proper PostgreSQL types
3. **Truncated Logic**: Business logic is being cut off or simplified incorrectly
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Exception handling is not comprehensive

To achieve the expected output quality, you would need to:

1. **Enhance the parsing logic** to handle complex nested Oracle trigger structures
2. **Improve variable extraction** to capture all declarations with proper type conversions
3. **Fix the section extraction** to include all business logic without truncation
4. **Implement comprehensive error handling** conversion
5. **Add complete data type mappings** for Oracle to PostgreSQL conversion

The expected JSON files show much more complete and properly formatted PostgreSQL code that would be executable, while your current output appears to be incomplete conversions that would likely fail when executed.

Would you like me to help you fix specific parts of the conversion logic to improve the output quality?
